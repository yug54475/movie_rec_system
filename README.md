# movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity.
A content-based movie recommender system built using the TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset. This project suggests similar movies based on the movie you like, using NLP and cosine similarity techniques.

## Features

- Recommend top 5 similar movies
- TMDB poster and overview integration via API
- Preprocessing of movie metadata including genres, cast, director, keywords
- Pickle-based model for fast predictions
- Streamlit web app interface for interactive usage

## Dataset

- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`

## How It Works

- Extracts key features: genres, cast, crew, keywords
- Combines into a single textual "tag" for each movie
- Vectorizes tags using CountVectorizer
- Calculates similarity scores using cosine similarity
- Returns top N most similar movies
